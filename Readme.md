Transit Tracks is an in development android app designed to provide real time info about nearby transit routes. As a hobby project the scope of this app will remain limited, with BC Transit Victoria and Metro Vancouver's Translink being the systems I intend to support.

This app uses a Room database to store and query static GTFS data. 

Please note that the Google Maps API key needed to run this app is not included in this git repo. Instructions on how to create one can be found in the AndroidManifest.xml file, and the API key can be placed in a local.properties file on your own device.
